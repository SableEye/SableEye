- Hi, Iâ€™m @SableEye but you can call me Sable.
- I'm looking to use GitHub to keep track of projects and grow my coding skills
- Currently, I am learning the basis of Python and SQL, as well as, looking into introductory data analyitics
- Collaboration is not currently a high priority for me just due to not having enough technical skill with programming yet
